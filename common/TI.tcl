# setTI
# Takes some basic arguments and builds a changing bias for DBC TI calculations
# Arguments:
#    cvName: the name of the colvar to be biased
#    biasType: the type of the bias
#    forceConst0: the force constant at lambda=0. (forceConstant)
#    forceConst1: the force constant at lambda=1. (targetForceConstant)
#    upperWalls: the upperWall of the restraint. 
#    nWindows: the number of lambda windows
#    equilSteps: the number of steps before computing TI gradients
#    stepsPerWindow: the number of steps for each lambda value
#    releaseFlag: a flag that indicates whether the restraint is being imposed 
#        or released. 0=imposed (force increased over time) 
#        1=released (force decreases over time)
# Results:
#    Creates a new bias based on the inputs and passes it to the Colvars module
